## Cash payment & change notification (v1 API)

Use these with the same `Authorization: Bearer {token}` (waiter or manager). Base path: `/api/v1`.

### POST /payments/cash/change-notification (before payment)

Get the change to give to the customer **before** confirming cash payment. Show this in the app so the waiter knows how much to give back.

**Request**
```json
{ "order_id": 45, "amount_received": 10000 }
```

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order_id": 45,
  "order_total": 9500,
  "amount_received": 10000,
  "change_to_give": 500,
  "message": "Change to give to customer: 500 Tsh"
}
```

Then call `POST /payments/cash` to record the payment.

### POST /payments/cash

Record a cash payment. Optionally send `amount_received`; response will include `change_to_give` for receipt/notification.

**Request**
```json
{ "order_id": 45 }
```
or
```json
{ "order_id": 45, "amount_received": 10000 }
```

**Response 200**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payment": { "id": 1, "order_id": 45, "amount": 9500, "method": "cash", "status": "paid", ... }
}
```
When `amount_received` was sent:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payment": { ... },
  "change_to_give": 500,
  "order_total": 9500,
  "amount_received": 10000,
  "message": "Change to give to customer: 500 Tsh"
}
```
